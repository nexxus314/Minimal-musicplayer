🎵 Minimal — A Clean React Music Player (JioSaavn API)

A beautifully simple, lightweight music player built using React + Tailwind, powered by the unofficial JioSaavn API, streaming high-quality MP4/AAC audio directly — with search, play/pause, next/previous controls, and a mobile-friendly UI.

✔ Song List View + Player View
✔ Minimal clean UI (header, hero section, footer)
